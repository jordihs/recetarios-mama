# Specification Quality Checklist: Recipe Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All ambiguous points were resolved with documented defaults in the Assumptions section
  (nested legacy chapter flattening, recipes at the legacy book root, cascade deletion,
  default PDF folder, A4 print target, first-text-as-description). Review them during
  `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan` if any default should change.
- "Rich text editor", "toggle button", and "configuration menu" wording comes directly
  from the user's feature description (interaction requirements), not from a technology
  choice; no specific framework, storage engine, or PDF library is mandated.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
